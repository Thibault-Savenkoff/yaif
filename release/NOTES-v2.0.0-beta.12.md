Twelfth beta: **two fixes in the Windows installer.**

Still a **beta**: `.yaif` files written by this build are not guaranteed to be readable by v2.0.0
final, and **v1 and v2 files are not compatible** either way.

## What changed

- **Uninstalling removes the PowerShell profile line.** The line that loads tab completion stayed in
  your PowerShell profiles after an uninstall with the `-setup.exe` (harmless: it loads nothing once the
  folder is gone, but it was meant to be removed).
- **Settings > Apps shows the install size** for the `-setup.exe` install.
- Nothing else changed: files from earlier betas, and this one, open as before.

## Install

Linux (x86_64 and arm64) and macOS (universal):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thibault-Savenkoff/yaif/v2/install.sh | bash
```

`--system` installs into `/usr/local`, `--no-plugins` skips the viewers, `-y` skips every prompt.
From a downloaded archive, no network: unpack it and run `./install.sh` inside, or
`install.sh --from yaif-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz`. To remove everything it installed, and
nothing else:

```sh
bash ~/.local/share/yaif/install.sh --uninstall     # add --system or --prefix DIR if you installed with it
```

Windows (64-bit): the `-setup.exe`, or the `.msi` for deployment tools, or the `.zip` for no
installer at all.

**Verify a download** against `SHA256SUMS` (attached, and listed below):

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

Browser: [the web page](https://thibault-savenkoff.github.io/yaif/) still runs v1 until v2 reaches
`main`.

## Known limits

- The Windows installers are **not code-signed**, so SmartScreen shows "unknown publisher", and
  Defender may report `Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.C!ml` — a machine-learning false positive on unsigned
  NSIS installers. Each new build is judged afresh.
- **Windows Photos** and the **iOS Photos** app accept no third-party codec: `.yaif` opens in
  Windows Photo Viewer instead, and shows blank in Photos.
- **macOS has no Finder or Quick Look support** — the CLI works; a native ImageIO plugin is not
  written yet.
- **Nautilus does not generate `.yaif` thumbnails** on GNOME, though Loupe opens the files and
  double-click works.
- No Windows on ARM build yet.

## Reporting

Please open an issue with the file, the command, and `yaif info file.yaif`.
